## 🧠 What is AIPOLIS?

AIPOLIS is not a tool.  
It is a **political operating system** — a programmable layer of governance that empowers communities, not ideologies.

It reimagines how policies are created, verified, and adapted —  
through collective intelligence, digital identity, and transparent algorithms.
