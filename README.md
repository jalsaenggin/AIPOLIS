## 🧠 What is AIPOLIS?

AIPOLIS is not a tool.  
It is a **political operating system** — a programmable layer of governance that empowers **communities**, not ideologies.

We reimagine how policies are created, verified, and evolved — through **algorithmic justice**, **collective intelligence**, and **digital citizenship**.
